<h2>Eat more Fiber</h2>
<p>The health authorities recommend that women eat 25 grams of fiber per day and that men eat 38 grams per day.There is conflicting evidence about whether fiber can help people lose weight or not.

Some fibers bind water in the intestine, which can slow absorption of nutrients and increase feelings of fullness.

There are in fact some studies showing that increasing dietary fiber can cause weight loss by automatically reducing calorie intake.

However, this depends on the type of fiber. Some types have no effect on weight, while certain soluble fibers can have a significant effect.

Bottom Line: Consuming adequate amounts of soluble, fermentable fiber is very important for optimal health, because it optimizes the function of the friendly bacteria in the gut.</p>

<h2>Don't eat processed foods</h2>
<p>	Processed foods and beverages are the biggest sources of added sugar and HFCS in the diet. Sugar is very unhealthy and can have serious adverse effects on metabolism when consumed in excess.

Food manufacturers spend massive amounts of resources on making their foods as “rewarding” as possible to the brain, which leads to overconsumption.

Most highly processed foods are loaded with artificial chemicals, including flavorants, texturants, colorants and preservatives.

For many people, junk foods can hijack the biochemistry of the brain, leading to downright addiction and cause them to lose control over their consumption.

The carbohydrates you find in processed foods are usually refined, simple carbohydrates. These lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels and cause negative health effects.

There are many nutrients found in whole foods that are not found in processed foods. The more processed foods you eat, the less you will get of these nutrients.

Soluble, fermentable fiber has various important health benefits, but most processed foods are very low in fiber because it is lost or intentionally removed during processing.

We only burn half as many calories digesting and metabolizing processed foods compared to whole foods.</p>

<h2>Oils that are extremy unhealthy</h2>
<p>	Processed seed and vegetable oils like soybean and canola oils are often mistakenly assumed to be healthy.

This is a huge mistake. These oils werent available to humans until a hundred years ago, because the technology to process them wasnt available.

Their fatty acid composition is completely different than anything we were ever exposed to throughout evolution, being very high in Omega six fatty acids, which can cause problems when consumed in excess.

These oils are also loaded with trans fats… which are highly toxic and strongly associated with metabolic problems and heart disease.

It is best to eat healthy, natural fats like coconut oil, butter and extra virgin olive oil, but to avoid processed sugar-sweetened and vegetable oils like the plague.</p>

<h2>Sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages are harmful</h2>
<p>	The harmful effects of sugar go way beyond empty calories.

It is now known that due to the large amount of fructose, sugar can lead to all sorts of metabolic problems and is strongly associated with the risk of chronic disease.

Sugar is bad, but consuming it in liquid form is even worse.

Liquid sugar calories don’t get registered by the brain in the same way as solid sugar calories, so the brain doesn’t compensate by eating less of other foods.

If anything, sugar-sweetened beverages are the single most fattening and disease promoting aspect of the modern diet.

One study shows that the risk of obesity in children is increased by 60% for each single daily serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage.

Unfortunately, fruit juice isn’t much better. It is very similar to a sugar-sweetened beverage and the small amounts of vitamins do NOT make up for the large amounts of sugar.</p>
